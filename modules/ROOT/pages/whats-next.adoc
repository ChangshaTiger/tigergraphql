= What's next

We are actively developing new features for TigerGraph GraphQL Service.
Here is a list of features in development:

* GraphQL Mutation to change graph data
* Parameterized GraphQL queries
* GraphQL fragments
* Support for `order-by` and `limit` on fields that represent outgoing edges from the vertices
* GraphQL aliases

We are eager to learn which features are most important to you, our users.
Please give us your feedback by posting at https://community.tigergraph.com/.
